    "## **Part 1: Research and Analysis of DDoS Attack Techniques (Unchanged)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Students will conduct in-depth research on the common methods used to execute Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, focusing on the layers of the OSI model they target and how they operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Task A: Categorization and Description  \n",

    "### Volumetric\n",
    "Volumetric attacks seek to saturate all available bandwidth between the victim and the rest of the Internet. Their main objective is to “fill the pipe” with junk traffic so that legitimate packets cannot reach the server. They operate mainly in layers 3 (network) and 4 (transport) of the OSI model, generating enormous volumes of packets per second. An example of this type is NTP Amplification, which exploits misconfigured time servers (NTP): the attacker sends small UDP queries with the victim's spoofed IP, and the server responds with much larger packets addressed to that victim, generating a massive flow of traffic. Another example is SSDP Amplification, which uses vulnerable devices that implement UPnP/SSDP; by sending requests with spoofed IPs, the devices respond to the target, flooding its network with amplified traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Protocol\n",
    "Protocol attacks, also known as state exhaustion attacks, do not always require large volumes of data; their goal is to exhaust the state tables and resources of devices such as firewalls, load balancers, and servers. They continue to act on layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model, but instead of just consuming bandwidth, they fill the memory structures where connections are recorded. One example is the TCP ACK Flood, where massive TCP packets with forged ACK flags are sent; the server must process them, which consumes CPU and other resources, preventing it from handling legitimate traffic. Another example is the IP Fragmentation attack (Teardrop/Fragmentation Flood), which exploits IP or UDP packet fragmentation to send malformed fragments or fragments designed to confuse reassembly at the destination or routers, which can collapse the network stack or cause failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application Layer\n",
    "Application layer attacks target layer 7 of the OSI model, where protocols such as HTTP, DNS, and SMTP reside, and aim to exhaust the application's resources (web server threads, processes, database queries, etc.). Unlike volumetric attacks, they may use little bandwidth, but they mimic legitimate traffic very well, making them difficult to detect. One example is DNS Flood, where a large volume of DNS requests (not necessarily amplified) are sent to a name server in order to saturate it and cause failures or slowdowns in name resolution. Another modern example is an HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack, where HTTP/2 (or similar) features are abused to generate many canceled or incomplete requests, forcing the server to process them repeatedly and exhausting its resources, without the need for a high volume of data. \n",

    "### NTP amplification\n",
    "The NTP amplification attack is a type of volumetric reflection and amplification DDoS attack that abuses the Network Time Protocol (NTP), used to synchronize time between systems. Its central idea is to send very small NTP requests to vulnerable servers, spoofing the victim's IP address, so that those servers respond with much larger responses directed at the target. In many cases, the historical monlist command is exploited, which returns a list of up to 600 recent clients; this can generate responses tens or even hundreds of times larger than the original request. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mechanism:\n",
    "- The attacker (or their botnet) sends UDP packets to port 123 of multiple misconfigured NTP servers.\n",
    "- Each packet carries the victim's IP as the source address (IP spoofing).\n",
    "- The NTP server processes the request (e.g., monlist) and generates a very large response.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these responses are sent to the victim, who never actually made the request. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resource exhaustion:\n",
    "The main resource affected is bandwidth: the link to/from the victim's network becomes saturated with unsolicited UDP traffic, preventing legitimate traffic (web, email, VPN, etc.) from passing through. In addition, the huge number of packets can overload routers, firewalls, and other intermediate equipment, causing congestion or even service outages upstream, not just on the target server. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Botnets and amplification:\n",
    "The danger of the attack skyrockets when it combines a botnet that sends many small requests from thousands of compromised computers, thousands of vulnerable NTP servers acting as “mirrors,” and an amplification factor that can exceed 100x in some scenarios.\n",
    "Thus, a few megabits of request traffic can be transformed into hundreds of gigabits of response traffic against the victim, as seen in real attacks of over 400 Gbps, making NTP Amplification one of the most efficient variants of volumetric DDoS."

In Application Layer attacks like SQLi hackers attacks webapps to steal data and informationto get an economic benefit in order to rescue the data. In the other hand, DDoS attacks main objective is to deny the service, endangering the communication of the server with internet and, in the case of entrepise applications and services, stopping all the production of the enterpise, asking for a economic benefit to stop the attack. Also, Application Layer attacks like SQLi take advantage of the infrastructure and communication between layers of the app to get sensitive or restricted information which shouldn't be accessed with actual roles and permission; for this reason, an important knowledge about frameworks, languages, OS and infraestructure of the app is useful to exploit some known vulnerabilities and access data. On the other side, DDoS attacks take advantage of the infraestructure limitations (CPU, RAM, bandwitch) to overcharge services, limiting the functionality; for this reason, a big computational resource is needed to overwhelm servers used in enterprises.\n",
