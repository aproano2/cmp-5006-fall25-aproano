## Final Project

### **Group 1: The Economics and Ethics of the Zero-Day Market**

This group should focus on the hidden ecosystem surrounding **zero-day vulnerabilities** as described in the book.

* **Focus Area:** The zero-day arms race, the broker market (like Zerodium), and the ethical quandaries faced by researchers, government agencies, and tech companies.  
* **Deliverables:**  
  * A presentation analyzing the **supply chain** of a zero-day exploit, from discovery to weaponization (who finds it, who buys it, and how it's used).  
  * An economic model or framework that attempts to quantify the **opportunity cost** of *not* patching a vulnerability versus the cost of *exploiting* it.  
  * A **policy proposal** arguing for or against the regulation of the zero-day market. The proposal should address the "patch vs. hoard" dilemma (should vulnerabilities be immediately disclosed or kept secret for offensive/intelligence purposes?).

### **Group 2: Geopolitics and the Cyber-Industrial Complex**

This group should analyze the book's portrayal of the intersection of **cyber power, national security, and international relations**, focusing on the state actors and the development of cyber warfare capabilities.

* **Focus Area:** The role of the NSA (Tailored Access Operations), Unit 61398 (China), and other state-sponsored actors; the concept of **mutually assured disruption** in cyberspace; and the use of cyberattacks as instruments of state power (e.g., Stuxnet).  
* **Deliverables:**  
  * A **comparative analysis** of the cyber capabilities and strategies of at least three nations mentioned in the book (e.g., the US, China, Russia, Israel).  
  * A **scenario simulation** detailing a major geopolitical conflict escalating through cyberattacks, outlining the "rules of engagement" or lack thereof in modern cyber warfare.  
  * An analysis of the **"export" of offensive cyber capabilities** and how that has destabilized global security (the proliferation of cyberweapons).

### **Group 3: The Human Element and Defense Strategy**

This group should shift focus to the **vulnerability of infrastructure and the role of defenders**, examining the book's narrative from a defensive, human-centric security perspective.

* **Focus Area:** The impact of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure (power grids, financial systems), the motivations and psychology of hackers/defenders, and practical defensive measures that could mitigate the risks described.  
* **Deliverables:**  
  * A **case study analysis** of a major attack detailed in the book (e.g., the 2016 DNC hack, or a specific zero-day use), outlining the **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)** and proposing effective **mitigation and recovery strategies**.  
  * A report on the **"talent gap"** in cybersecurity—the challenges of recruiting and retaining ethical security professionals versus the lure of the offensive side.  
  * A final report arguing for the **most critical defensive priority** (e.g., secure coding standards, mandatory two-factor authentication for government, national-level bug bounty programs) that would best counter the threats highlighted in Perlroth's work.
